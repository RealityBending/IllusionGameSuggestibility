**Project Title:** Validation of the Illusion Game

**Project Description**

This online study includes a perceptual decision-making task (the "Illusion Game"), accompanied by personality questionnaires. 
The goal is to 1) validate the Illusion Game as a reliable measure of illusion sensitivity and 2) investigate the correlates with other dispositional measures. 
The study's duration is approximately 30min, and it contains the following elements:

- Consent form

At the beginning, participants will be shown information about the study's goal (no deception is involved). 
The page also emphasizes that their response and participation will be kept confidential and entirely anonymous (no IP address, or any identifiers are collected). 
Participant's data is saved only at the end of the study (giving them a chance to retract their participation till the end).

- Demographic information

Participants will then undergo a brief demographic survey, to collect voluntary information concerning their age, gender, highest attained education level, and ethnicity to better describe the characteristics and representativeness of the sample.

- Questionnaires

1) The IPIP-6 (Sibley et al., 2011) measures 6 "normal" personality traits (Extraversion, Openness, Conscientiousness, Agreeableness, Neuroticism and Honesty-Humility) with 24-items on analog scales.
2) The PID-5 (Krueger et al., 2011) measures 5 "pathological" (i.e., maladaptive) personality traits (Disinhibition, Antagonism, Detachment, Negative Affect and Psychoticism) with 25-items on Likert scales.
3) The SSS-21 (Kotov et al., 2004) is a condensed version of the multidimensional Iowa suggestibility scale and measures participants' sensibility and adaptability with 21-items on Likert scales.
4) The MIST-20 (Maertens et al 2020) measures participants ability to discriminate between real and fake news with 20 dichotomous items.

- Illusion Game

The Illusion Task (Makowski et al., 2023) is a reaction time task in which participants must make perceptual judgments (e.g., "which red line is the longer") as quickly and accurately as possible, without making any errors. There are of 3 illusion types (Ebbinghaus, MÃ¼ller-Lyer and Vertical-Horizontal), and the illusion strength and task difficulty is manipulated orthogonally.

- Debriefing

Participants will be given some further information at the end of the study.

- Randomization

The tasks order is as follows: 2 questionnaires, followed by the first block of the Illusion Game (starting with a practice). Then, a third questionnaire, followed by the second Illusion Game block. The order of the questionnaires is randomized.

- Participants

Participants will be recruited via convenience sampling (e.g., via social media), or via other recruitment platforms if available (e.g., SONA, Prolific). 
The samples from different methods of recruitment will be collected separately in case they are different (the incentive type - e.g., student credits - and amount - or lack thereof - will thus be known to mitigate its potential effect).
As we aim at recruiting a diverse sample, there are no exclusion criteria beside having to do the experiment on a computer/laptop (as it is not mobile friendly).

- Risks

There are no risks involved in this study.

**Section A**

No.

**Section B**

- B.1: The goal is to recruit at least 30 participants but given the correlational nature of the study and of the recruitment procedure, a higher number is desired.
- B.2: The research will involve primary data collection, using convenience sampling (in which case the researcher's entourage will be invited to participate) or other platforms if available (e.g., SONA).
- B.3: The study is composed of one perceptual decision making task (the Illusion Game) and questionnaires.
- B.4: Participants will be able to partake in the study online from their computers.
