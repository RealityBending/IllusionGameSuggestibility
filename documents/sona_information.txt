**2 credits** | 30min online study | Can you resist visual illusions?

This study aims at validating a reaction time game based on visual illusions.

In this study, you will be required to complete various questionnaires about yourself, as well as play the Illusion Game, a speed game where you have to answer as fast as possible visual challenges (e.g., which red circle is bigger) while trying to not be biased by the illusions.
