// MIST-16 (Maertens et al., 2023)
// We recommend to calculate and report all five scores of the Verification done framework:
// - V (Veracity Discernment): V can be calculated by scoring each of the responses on a binary 0 (incorrect) or 1 (correct) metric and taking the sum of the score.
// - r (Real News Detection): The sum of all scores for the real news items results in the r score.
// - f (Fake News Detection): The sum of all scores for the fake news items results in the f score.
// - d (Distrust): To calculate d, all responses must be scored on a binary 0 (not fake news) or 1 (fake news) metric, independent of whether the response is correct or incorrect. The sum of this amount of fake news judgements should then be subtracted by 10 (MIST-20), 8 (MIST-16), or 4 (MIST-8), and this results in the distrust score. If the resulting score is below 0, the score should be corrected to 0.
// - n (Naïvité): To calculate n, all responses must be scored on a binary 0 (not real news) or 1 (real news), independent of whether the response is correct or incorrect. The sum of this amount of real news judgements should then be subtracted by 10 (MIST-20), 8 (MIST-16), or 4 (MIST-8), and this results in the naïvité score. If the resulting score is below 0, the score should be corrected to 0.
